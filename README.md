# Capstone Project Requirements

## Introduction

Congratulations on making it to the final project! It's been a long journey, but we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel!

![Actual Footage of you seeing the light at the end of the tunnel](/end-of-tunnel.gif)

Now that you've learned everything we have to teach you, it's time to show off and flex your data science muscles with your own **_Capstone Project_**! This project will allow you to showcase everything you've learned as a data scientist to by completing a professional-level data science project of your choosing. This project will be significantly larger than any project you've completed so far, and will be the crown jewel of your portfolio. A strong capstone project is the single most important thing you can do to get the attention of potential employers, so be prepared to put as much effort into this project as possible - the results will be **_worth it!_**

## Topic Requirements

Your project should develop a data product or analysis related to a single topic. You are completely free to choose any topic that interests you, but keep in mind that you will need to complete this project end-to-end, potentially including sourcing your own data. When choosing a topic, think through these questions:  

* What would I be motivated to work on?
* What data could I use?
* How could an individual or organization use my product or findings?
* What will I be able to accomplish in the time I have available?
* What challenges do I foresee with this project?

## Technical Requirements

Your project must meet the following technical requirements:

1. **_No Off-The-Shelf Datasets_**. This project is a chance for you to highlight your critical thinking and data sourcing skills by finding a good dataset to answer a useful question. You _can_ use a pre-existing dataset, but you should consider combining it with other datasets and/or engineering your own features. The goal is to showcase your ability to find and work with data, so just grabbing a toy dataset that's squeaky-clean is out of the question. If it comes pre-packaged in scikit learn, it's not an option!

2. **_Strong Data Exploration, with Captivating and Informative Data Visualizations._**  There are few skills that impress employers more than the ability to dive into a new dataset and produce engaging visualizations that communicate important information. For this project, anything worth knowing is worth visualizing. Level up your project by digging into more advanced visualization libraries or potentially building something out in Tableau/Power BI!

3. **_Supervised Learning_**. It is great to use **_unsupervised learning_** techniques as needed in your project (for instance, segmentation with clustering algorithms), but supervised learning should play a central role in answering your question. 

4. **_Explicit Usage of a Data Science Process (such as OSEMN or CRISP-DM)_**. Select a Data Science Process to use to give structure to your project. Each step in the process should correspond to a section in a main Jupyter Notebook, or to separate Jupyter Notebooks.  

5. **_Well-Defined Goal with Clearly Presented Results._** Your project should provide any background context needed to understand the project you are working on and why it's important. For instance, if you are trying to detect fault lines using Earthquake data, you should review the topic and your dataset so that the reader can understand your work.  Similarly, the results of your project should be clearly communicated. Do not just tell your audience the final accuracy of your models - be sure to answer "big picture" questions as well. For instance: Would you recommend shipping this model to production, or is more work needed? Ask yourself throughout - **"SO WHAT??"**

**_NOTE:_** Inconclusive results are _okay_ - from a purely scientific perspective, they are no more or less important or valuable than any other kinds of results. If your results are inconclusive, you should discuss what that teaches you and what your next steps would be from there. For instance, what do you think it would take to get conclusive results: More data? Different data that was unavailable? Both? 

## Requirements

Your project will be evaluated based on the contents of your GitHub repository, which must contain the following  components:

1. Jupyter notebook(s)   
2. README file 
3. Presentation 

The requirements for these components are described in detail in the rubric for the final capstone project [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUC5_QVu8BEd7xBJumzspH40-KuJtL9KQInQYXGi5bE/edit?usp=sharing). You can learn how your teacher will use the rubric to review the project [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-campus-capstone-project-review).

**_NOTE:_** You'll see that data is not a component listed above. It is entirely possible that your data will be too large for a GitHub repository, and certain projects may rely on sensitive data that you should not upload to GitHub. That's okay! You should include a detailed explanation of where your data was sourced in your README, and provide a sample of the data that avoids the issues inherent in your full dataset if possible.

**ADDITIONALLY** you must record a video of the presentation being given and upload it. We will provide instructions on how to do this!

## Example Student Project

Take a look at this [technical report](https://github.com/paulinaczheng/twitter_flu_tracking) from a Flatiron student that used Twitter data to predict the weekly number of flu cases during flu season. Pay attention to how well structured the project is, and how much she relies on great visualizations to tell her story for her. Your explanations don't have to be wordy - a visualization is worth a thousand words!

## The Timeline

Deadlines are denoted in **bold**, the rest are strong suggestions to help keep you on track.

- May 13: If you have multiple ideas and are looking for instructor feedback, you should pitch 3 thought-out ideas to Bryan by the first Wednesday of the capstone module

- **May 15**: You _must_ have Bryan approve your full project design by **Friday, May 15**. This isn't just a Slack message that says "hey I'm doing this" but rather should be a thought-out project pitch in which you outline your data, your goals, potential pitfalls you foresee, the SO-WHAT of your project, etc. By this point, you also _must_ have gathered all the data you'll be using (if relevant)

- **May 22**: Your repository _must_ be set up, with a README and with at least one Jupyter Notebook, by **Friday, May 22**. This will allow the instructors to begin grading your project, so take the repository set-up seriously! We suggest that you finish any modeling and evaluation by this point (end of week 2), allowing plenty of time for you to work on your presentation and to further clean up your code and GitHub

- **May 27, 12pm**: All modeling, presentation preparation, and deployment should be completed by **_NOON on Wednesday, May 27_**! 

- **May 28, 12pm**: Video _must_ be complete and uploaded, so all of the videos can be prepared for the Project Showcase

- **May 28, 4:30-7pm**: **PROJECT SHOWCASE** Let's get this Zoom meeting packed with supporters, curious onlookers, and (most importantly) potential employers. Bring your A-Game. You got this.

- **May 29**: Last blog post due! We encourage you to do a writeup of the information you conveyed in your presentation about your Capstone - it'll be another way to showcase all of your hard work!

## Summary

The Capstone Project is the most critical part of the program. It gives you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned into realistic projects and to practice key "business judgement" and communication skills.  Most importantly, it provides employers with strong signal about your technical abilities, and allow you to show the world what an amazing Data Scientist you've become!

The projects are serious and important - **they can be passed and they can be failed.** Take the project seriously, put the time in, ask for help from your peers or instructors _early and often_ if you need it, and treat the review as a job interview and you'll do great. We're rooting for you to succeed and we're only going to ask you to take a review again if we believe that you need to. We'll also provide open and honest feedback so you can improve as quickly and efficiently as possible.
